      <h1>✨ How This Was Made</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">The technology behind your recipe app</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 1: The Overview -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>📖 The Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Kyle built this recipe app in about one afternoon by having a conversation 
        with an AI assistant called <strong>Claude</strong>. Rather than writing 
        thousands of lines of code by hand, he described what he wanted in plain 
        English, and the AI generated the code. He reviewed it, requested changes, 
        and iterated until it was right.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach — describing what you want and letting AI handle the 
        implementation details — is sometimes called <strong>"vibe coding."</strong> 
        It's a significant shift in how software gets built.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 2: What is AI, Really? -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>🧠 What is AI, Really?</h2>
      <p>
        AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to computer systems that can perform 
        tasks that traditionally required human intelligence — like reading handwriting, 
        understanding language, or recognizing patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AI used here (Claude, made by a company called Anthropic) is a 
        <strong>large language model</strong>. It was trained on billions of pages of 
        text — books, articles, code, documents — and learned to predict patterns in 
        language. Through this training, it developed the ability to understand context, 
        follow instructions, and generate coherent responses.
      </p>
      
      <div class="analogy-box">
        <p>
          <strong>A chemistry analogy:</strong> Training an AI model is somewhat like 
          optimizing a reaction. You have inputs (training data), conditions (the model 
          architecture), and you iteratively adjust parameters to minimize error — similar 
          to how you'd tune temperature, pressure, or catalysts to maximize yield. The 
          "trained model" is the stable, optimized result.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        What's remarkable is that these models can now <em>see</em> images. When you 
        upload a photo of your handwritten recipe card, the AI analyzes the pixels, 
        recognizes the letter forms, and extracts the text — including your cursive! 
        This capability barely existed three years ago.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 3: The Architecture -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>🏗️ How the System Works</h2>
      <p>
        Your recipe app has four main components:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>The Frontend</strong> — What you see and interact with. It's a website 
        (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) hosted for free on GitHub Pages.</li>
        <li><strong>The Database</strong> — Where your recipes are stored. Think of it as a 
        structured spreadsheet in the cloud, with columns for recipe name, ingredients, 
        directions, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>The Storage Bucket</strong> — Where the original photos of your recipe 
        cards are kept. Like a folder on the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>The API Layer</strong> — The middleman that connects everything. When 
        you upload a photo, the API receives it, sends it to Claude for reading, gets back 
        the extracted text, and saves it to the database.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="diagram">
        <div class="diagram-title">What happens when you upload a recipe:</div>
        <div class="diagram-flow">
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">Your phone</span> Takes photo, sends to server</div>
          <div class="diagram-arrow">↓</div>
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">Storage</span> Photo saved to cloud bucket</div>
          <div class="diagram-arrow">↓</div>
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">API</span> Sends image to Claude AI</div>
          <div class="diagram-arrow">↓</div>
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">Claude</span> Reads handwriting, returns structured data</div>
          <div class="diagram-arrow">↓</div>
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">Database</span> Recipe saved with all fields</div>
          <div class="diagram-arrow">↓</div>
          <div class="diagram-step"><span class="label">Your phone</span> Shows the new recipe!</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        An <span class="tech-term">API</span> (Application Programming Interface) is simply 
        a defined way for different software systems to communicate. When the website needs 
        to save a recipe, it sends a structured request to the API; the API processes it 
        and sends back a response. It's like a standardized form that both parties agree to use.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A <span class="tech-term">database</span> is structured data storage. Unlike a Word 
        document or a pile of index cards, a database organizes information into tables with 
        defined columns. This makes it fast to search ("show me all cookie recipes") and 
        reliable (data doesn't get corrupted or lost).
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 4: The Conversation -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>💬 How Kyle Built This</h2>
      <p>
        Kyle used a tool called <strong>Cursor</strong>, which is a code editor with AI 
        built in. Instead of typing code directly, he typed requests like this:
      </p>
      
      <div class="code-example">
        <span class="comment">// Kyle's request:</span><br>
        <span class="kyle">"Add a PIN screen so only family can access the recipes. 
        Store the PIN securely so it can't be seen in the code."</span><br><br>
        <span class="comment">// AI's response:</span><br>
        <span class="ai">[Generates the PIN screen code, creates a secure 
        server function to verify it, updates the database schema]</span><br><br>
        <span class="comment">// Kyle reviews, then:</span><br>
        <span class="kyle">"Make the PIN input larger and add a 'shake' animation 
        if the wrong code is entered."</span><br><br>
        <span class="ai">[Updates the code accordingly]</span>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        This back-and-forth continued for a few hours. Kyle didn't need to know the 
        syntax of every programming language involved — he just needed to know what 
        he wanted and how to evaluate whether the result was correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why it's called "vibe coding" — you describe the vibe, the feel, 
        the behavior you want, and the AI handles the technical implementation.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 5: Why This Matters -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>⚡ Why This is Significant</h2>
      <p>
        Three years ago, building an app like this would have required:
      </p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>A professional developer (or team) working for weeks</li>
        <li>Setting up and maintaining servers</li>
        <li>Licensing or training an OCR (optical character recognition) system — which still probably wouldn't handle cursive well</li>
        <li>Significant cost — easily thousands of dollars</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Today, with AI-assisted development and modern cloud services, Kyle built this 
        in an afternoon at minimal cost. The monthly expense to run this app is about 
        $25 — less than a dinner out.
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, the cursive handwriting recognition <em>actually works</em>. 
        That's the part that was nearly impossible until very recently. The same AI 
        that can read your handwritten recipe cards can also write code, answer questions, 
        and analyze images — capabilities that are genuinely new in the world.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Section 6: The Stack -->
    <div class="story-section">
      <h2>🛠️ The Technical Stack</h2>
      <p>For the curious, here's exactly what powers your recipe app:</p>
      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li><strong>Claude (Anthropic)</strong> — The AI that reads handwriting and helped write the code</li>
        <li><strong>Cursor</strong> — The AI-enabled code editor Kyle used</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — Provides the database, file storage, and API layer (a "backend-as-a-service")</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> — Free website hosting for the frontend</li>
        <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> — The database engine (runs inside Supabase)</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong> — The languages the website is written in</li>
      </ul>
